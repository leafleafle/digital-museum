                                    <p>The 2000s saw a rapid increase in OFWS, as more Filipinos applied as household service workers abroad and production workers, which affected family dynamics. The emotional and nurturing roles of OFW fathers were reduced to mostly just a financial provider. Usually the eldest sibling fills in for the place of the absent parent. In 2006, Skype launched video calling for phones which helped mitigate the effects. Most families relied on exchanging Yahoo e-mails through internet cafes. Parents become OFWs as a means to survive and financially provide for their family, which left a more emotional impact.</p>

                                    <p>People can now conveniently call and text their OFW relatives with popular social media platforms now interacting video calls as features. Skype has  shut down but Messenger has soared in popularity. There still exists an emotional gap but the effects of OFW migration are now somewhat mitigated. Compared to the 2000s where parents became forced to be OFWs to provide, there is more space for younger generations' personal aspirations on becoming an OFW aside from financial necessity.</p>

                                    <p>In other countries, little robots, known as telepresence robots, can go around and transmit the voice of a distant family member and be controlled by them makes it so that they can interact with their family in a more spatial way. This may become more popular in the Philippines as well. A lot of younger generations will aspire to be OFWs to maintain a high economic status rather than viewing it as a last resort.</p>

                                    <p>More and more english-proficient Filipinos joined the BPO industry. In 2000, the BPO revenue was approximately 100 million US dollars, comprising only 0.075% of the Philippine GDP. In 2005, the BPO industry's revenue was at 1.3 billion US Dollars (2.4% of GDP), and grew nearly tenfold by 2010 at 10.1 billion US Dollars (4.8% of GDP). In the 2000s, companies like Accenture grew fast in the Philippines when it expanded from just IT services to teleservices. PeopleSupport moved its operations to the Philippines in 2001 and also grew.</p>

                                    <p>Today, the BPO industry contributes to 8% to 9% of the Philippines' revenue, approximately 38 billion US Dollars as of 2024. By 2028, it is projected to hit 58 million US Dollars in revenue. Accenture is still a top-employer. PeopleSupport was acquired by Aegis, which is now part of Concentrix, another top-employer.</p>

                                    <p>Accenture will likely still be one of the top employers. Even though AI is a threat to workers in the BPO industry, instead of being replaced entirely, they will likely be given AI tools like CoPilot and Fireflies to assist with their jobs. Given this, and the fact that the industry is projected to hit 58 milion USD in revenue by 2028, it will probably hit the 60 million USD mark by 2030.</p>
